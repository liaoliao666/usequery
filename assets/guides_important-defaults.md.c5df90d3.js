If this concept sounds foreign, then don&#39;t worry about it! 99.9% of the time you will not need to disable this and it makes your app more performant at zero cost to you.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Structural sharing only works with JSON-compatible values, any other value types will always be considered as changed. If you are seeing performance issues because of large responses for example, you can disable this feature with the <code>config.structuralSharing</code> flag. If you are dealing with non-JSON compatible values in your query responses and still want to detect if data has changed or not, you can define a data compare function with <code>config.isDataEqual</code>.</p></blockquote>",11);n.render=function(o,a,n,r,l,s){return e(),t("div",null,[i])};export default n;export{a as __pageData};
